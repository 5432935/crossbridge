Create a fork\r\n1. Check out [TODOs](https://github.com/vpmedia/crossbridge/blob/master/TODO.md)\r\n1. Report a new issue, properly describing the situation - backed up with logs\r\n1. Submit a patch for the issue or ask others to do so\r\n1. Submit pull requests with complete set of new features\r\n\r\n#### Futures branch\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to support C++11 by upgrading the compiler infrastructure to the latest LLVM tool-chain (3.X) with FreeBSD 9+\r\n\r\n1. Create a fork\r\n1. Check out [TODOs](https://github.com/vpmedia/crossbridge/blob/futures/TODO.md)\r\n1.
