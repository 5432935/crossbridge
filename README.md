# [Crossbridge](http://www.crossbridge.io) 

Crossbridge is the open-source version of Adobe FlasCC (formerly the Alchemy project). 
It provides a complete C/C++ development environment for targeting the Adobe Flash Runtime.  

Features:

* LLVM-GCC 4.2 compiler with Flash backend
* GDB debugger that debugs your code while running in the Flash player
* SWIG backend that auto generates interop code allowing you to build Flash libs (SWCs) that wrap C/C++ libraries
* pthread based multi-threading (in Flash 11.5+)

### Getting started

* [Download a copy of SDK for your OS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossbridge/files/)
