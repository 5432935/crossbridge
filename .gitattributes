# Purpose: Since on Windows we're using Cygwin environment, we should use LF only mode
# @see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9976986/force-lf-eol-in-git-repo-and-working-copy
# @see: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings

# Default behaviour is to have LF only (Unix)
# TODO: TEST THIS =>             * text eol=lf

# Default behaviour is to auto detect text files
* text auto

# Explicit declaration of binary files that should not be modified
